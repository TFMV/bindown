          A template for this dependency. Any unset fields in this dependency will be set by values from the template.
          Overrides in the dependency and its template are concatinated with the template's overrides coming first.
          Vars and substitutions are both combined with the dependency's value taking precedence.

      vars:
        description: >
          A list of variables that can be used in 'url', 'archive_path' and 'bin'.

          Two variables are always added based on the current environment: 'os' and 'arch'. Those are the operating
          system and architecture as defined by go's GOOS and GOARCH variables. I should document what those are
          somewhere.

          You can reference a variable using golang template syntax. For example, you could have a url set to
          `https://example.org/mydependency/v{{.version}}/mydependency-{{.os}}-{{.arch}}.tar.gz`.  If you define the var
          'version: 1.2.3' and run bindown on a 64 bit Linux system, it will download
          `https://example.org/mydependency/v1.2.3/mydependency-linux-amd64.tar.gz`.
